    <p class="page-lead">Ska is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Types of Ska</h2>
      <p>There are two variations of ska music.</p>

      <div class="grid">
        <div class="half">
          <h3>2 Tone</h3>
          <p>The 2 Tone genre, which began in the late 1970s in the Coventry, England area, was a fusion of Jamaican ska rhythms and melodies with punk rock's more aggressive guitar chords and lyrics.[22] Compared to 1960s ska, 2 Tone music had faster tempos, fuller instrumentation and a harder edge. The genre was named after 2 Tone Records, a record label founded by Jerry Dammers of The Specials. In many cases, the reworking of classic ska songs turned the originals into hits again in the United Kingdom.</p>

        <div class="half">
          <h3>Third Wave</h3>
          <p>Third wave ska originated in the punk scene in the 1980s and became commercially successful in the 1990s. Although some third wave ska has a traditional 1960s sound, most third wave ska is characterized by dominating guitar riffs and large horn sections. Examples of third wave ska bands include Streetlight Manifesto, Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake, The Aquabats, Mustard Plug, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, and Goldfinger.</p>

      <p>The ska culture is friendly, full of dancing and black and white checkers.</p>

        <div class="half">
          <h3>Skanking</h3>
          <p>Skanking is a form of dancing practiced in the ska music scene.</p>
          <p>Originally, skanking consisted of a “running man” motion of the legs to the beat while alternating bent-elbow fist-punches, left and right.[1] Over time, however, variations have emerged across the musical world. The punk version features a sharp striking out look with the arms, and is sometimes used in moshing to knock around others doing the same. However, this is rarely seen as an act of true aggression but rather a consensual release of emotion.</p>
